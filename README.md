# ORIE4741-Project

Final project repository for ORIE4741: Big Messy Data.
Group members: Benjamin Luckow (bjl93), Joshua Caplan (jc2567)

In this project we generated our own dataset of news articles in order to train a model on embeddings generated by the Universal Sentence Encoder. In lieu of specialized NLP methods, we sought to draw conclusions on the relationship between text data and a publication using general machine learning methods.
